# Doggo

Doggo - an Elixir client library for the [dog.ceo](https://dog.ceo/dog-api/) Doggo API.

Unofficial library - just a bit of a giggle for me.  (Because who doesn't LOVE Doggos!?)

## Installation

If [available in Hex](https://hex.pm/docs/publish), the package can be installed
by adding `doggo` to your list of dependencies in `mix.exs`:

```elixir
def deps do
  [
    {:doggo, "~> 0.1.0"}
  ]
end
```
